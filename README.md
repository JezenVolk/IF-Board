# IF-Board

The Arduino Folder is copy and pasted directly from the Arduino IDE folder on my computer. This 
is because I couldn't figure out how to direct the include path to a location outside of the ${workspaceFolder}
I could have just ignored it, but the red squigglies were upsetting me, and I can't disable them because I need
to have error formatting on or I will make many many more mistakes.


This Code project is supposed to be control code for two ICs, and I have no idea how functional it is going to be.
